cReddit is a reddit clone that contains similar functionality as reddit. It has posts, comments fields, searching and filtering, and form validations. The goal of this project is to display competency in AngularJS basics.

There are currently a few kinks to work out. These include applying form validations to comment posts, as well as form submissions.
